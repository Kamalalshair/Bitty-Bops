/*
Wandering Script
Algorithm
*/

//Wait a random amount of frames that, at 60fps, would equal between 1-10 seconds

//Pet is center of a circle
//After waiting, pick a random spot on that circle's circumference

//That spot becomes the target for a random amount of frames between half a second and five seconds

//After, loop. this is an endless loop and the script is only disabled when a fruit is placed (fruit becomes target)


/*OPTIONAL*/
//Have a relatively small chance for the target's position to move along the circumference of the circle but on the same side
//of the vertical axis.
//Have an astronomically small chance for the target's position to move anywhere along the circumference of the circle
